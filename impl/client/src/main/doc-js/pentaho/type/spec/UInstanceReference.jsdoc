/**
 * The `spec.UInstanceReference` union represents the set of JS types that can be used to reference an instance.
 *
 * Instance references are the main arguments of methods such as
 * [ILoader#resolveInstance]{@link pentaho.type.ILoader#resolveInstance}
 * and
 * [Type#createAsync]{@link pentaho.type.Type#createAsync}.
 *
 * An instance reference can be
 * an instance specification, used for constructing a new instance, or
 * a resolve instance specification, used for resolving instances from the instances' container.
 *
 * @typedef {pentaho.type.spec.UInstance|pentaho.type.spec.IInstanceResolve} pentaho.type.spec.UInstanceReference
