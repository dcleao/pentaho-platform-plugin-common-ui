/**

 *
 * An object whose keys are type identifiers and whose values are type declarations.
 *
 * The following is a Type Info API configuration that declares two types,
 * `my/Abstract` and `my/Basic`,
 * where the latter is a subtype of the former:
 *
 * ```js
 * require.config({
 *   config: {
 *     "pentaho/typeInfo": {
 *       "my/Abstract": {alias: "A"},
 *       "my/Basic": {base: "A"}

 * });
