// TODO: ./properties/StandardNames enum
/**
 * The type of property model to use.
 *
 * When a string is specified, it can be a name with or without `"/"` characters.
 * If it contains no `"/"` characters,
 * then it must be the name of the module of a standard property type.
 * Modules of standard property types are children of `"pentaho/component/properties"`.
 *
 * The following are some of the standard property type names:
 * `"any"`, `"string"`, `"number"`, `"integer"`, `"positiveInteger"`, `"nonNegativeInteger"`,
 * `"boolean"`, `"date"`.
 *
 * Otherwise,
 * if it contains one or more `"/"` characters,
 * then it must be the AMD/RequireJS module _id_ of an existing property model class.
 * The module _must_ have already been loaded by the module system and
 * thus be obtainable through a synchronous `require` call: `require("my/properties/model")`.
 *
 * When a function is directly specified,
 * it must be a sub-class of {@link pentaho.component.properties.AnyModel}.
 * In this case, the model class may or may not have been defined in a separate module â€”
 * it can have been defined in module of the component model class.
